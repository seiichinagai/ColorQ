ColorQ is a minimalistic side scroller game written in Java.

The point of the game is to match your ship color to the wall in order to pass through it.
There are 3 colors, Red, Yellow and Blue, in that order. The colors are organized in a circular queue which is where the game
gets its name. The ship cycles through the color when the player presses the spacebar.
