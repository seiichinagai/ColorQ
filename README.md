ColorQ is a minimalistic side scroller game written in Java where the player matches the color of their ship
to the color of the oncoming wall, in order to pass through.

The game was built using LibGDX and Android studio. This structure of this program was based off of Brent Aurelli's Super Mario tutorial (https://github.com/BrentAureli/SuperMario).

As stated above, the point of the game is to match your ship color to the wall in order to pass through it.
There are 3 colors, Red, Yellow and Blue, in that order. The colors are organized in a circular queue which is where the game
gets its name. The ship cycles through the color when the player presses the spacebar. The Up and Down keys are used to move the ship.
